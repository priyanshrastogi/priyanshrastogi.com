# 2020: Fast Forward

If 2020 was a movie, it would be like "Himmatwala" playing in loop for 12 hours.

Welcome to the fourth edition of “Year in Review”.

Quiet roads, closed pubs, empty offices — Most of the world came to a halt in March. Countries announced lockdowns. I guess most of us didn’t imagine that we’ll ever experience anything like this in our lives, but we did. As I described in Year in Review — 2019 that last year wasn’t great for me anyway, so I hoped for a few things from this year.

#### Switching my first job

This year I left my job at American Express and joined an early-stage startup. I wanted to join an early-stage startup for a while because of the impact I can make from my work. Though (al)most of my family members were against my decision to leave such a highly stable, well-paying job. Moreover, I joined this startup without any hike in pay. Money doesn't matter if you are not happy with the work you are doing, so I had to take it and I don't have any regrets. In fact, Things have turned out to be pretty good till now. I have learned a lot since I joined Vested.


#### Video games

I was not a gamer, until this year. When you can’t go outdoors and are bored with Netflix, video games can make your life fun. I bought a PS4 this year and played some of the best games available to date. I played God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, Red Dead Redemption 2, Assassins Creed Odyssey, and Valhalla. But my personal favorite is Red Dead Redemption 2.

#### Exploring other things

Due to lockdown and unavailability of house help, my cooking game has gotten better than the house help. I made some dishes that I couldn't believe I nailed at the first attempt (though huge shoutouts to YFL, Kavita's Kitchen for real help through YouTube). I am also thinking to take cooking as the second profession. This year I also came across western classical music (Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Chopin) and it's my favorite genre now.

That's all folks for this year. Have a nice day. Happy new year!

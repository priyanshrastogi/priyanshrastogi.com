# 3 Mantras That Changed My Life This Month.

Till 2016, I lived a life in which, I never refused anything people gave me to do. I didn’t care about time that I’ll waste, trouble that I’ll have in doing that. What did I get in return? Not even a thanks sometimes. Or when I asked them to do something for me, they simply refused. So this 2017, I used some famous mantras. These mantras really brought some changes in my life.

**1\. Learn to say ‘No’.**

This semester, I wanted to take an elective. But it was clashing with one of my major courses. So I went to the professor of that major course. I requested him to shift me to another batch, So that the clash could be avoided and I could take that elective. But he said no. He didn’t want to take the responsibility and he didn’t have time to do all this. All he had do to is, write a mail to one person and CC it to me. So basically, No one in the world cares about you except your parents and some people, to whom, you really matter.

So yeah, After that incident I decided to do the same. So now whenever anyone come to me, asking for a favor. I analyse the work first. Does he/she really need my help or it is just a waste of time. But I do help if they really need my help. But if I got my own shit to deal with, Why would I care about their. I say ‘No’. It saves a lot of trouble and time. Trust me.

**2.** **Stop thinking that everybody is watching you. Seriously nobody gives a damn.**

I couldn’t do somethings just because the fear of “What will people think?”, Whenever I go to public places, I used to think, Ohh I shouldn’t do this, This will be so embarrassing for me. What will people think? But really they don’t give a damn about you. If I do something stupid, they will have a good laugh for like five minutes. And after that, they won’t give a damn, they’ve got their own shit to deal with. They don’t have time to remember what I did, most of them don’t even know me. So now whenever I go to public places or in a party or something I don’t really care if I do anything stupid or embarrassing, what will people think? And yeah I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, and wherever I want without any tension.

**3\. READ. Read anything but read.**

When Elon Musk was in 3rd or 4th grade, he ran out of books to read at the school library and the neighborhood library and started reading encyclopedia. Like really, when I was in 3rd or 4th grade, All I did is watched Cartoon Network. Well, Now I understand reading is really important. When Elon Musk was a child he read books about going to mars, find the aliens. He was pretty interested in that. Now he is the Founder and CEO of SpaceX and trying to colonize Mars. Reading improves our imagination. It enhances our knowledge. So this month I read some books. It was really helpful. It atleast gives me knowledge about every field.

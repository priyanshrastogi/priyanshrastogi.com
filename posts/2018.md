### 2018: The Year in Review

2018, The best year of my life so far. There are many things that made 2018 the best year of my life. However, I couldn’t do many things that I wanted to do this year.

Every year, we get old, we get mature. We define some goals or some revolutions for the year. Every year, we want to learn something new. We want to travel the world. We want to improve ourselves. So I will focus on three things: Learning, Self Improvement and Exploring the World.

#### Learning

This year, instead of learning many different things, I dived deeper into skills that I learned last year. I worked on sharpening my skills of Web Development. I dived deeper into Node.js, React, Redux and other JavaScript libraries and frameworks. I learned native mobile app development with React Native and Expo. I learned the basics of the Internet of Things and worked with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and sensors and built a wonderful [project](https://github.com/priyanshrastogi/parking-suggest). I learned the foundations of Data Mining and built some projects on Machine Learning.

#### Self Improvement

Reading books is one of the best ways to improve yourself. Last year I read around 10 books but this year I couldn’t even reach half of it. I read only 4 books this year. Among these four, [Factfulness by Hans Rosling](https://www.amazon.in/Factfulness-Reasons-Wrong-Things-Better/dp/1473637465) was the best. It talks about how the world is getting better than before every year but most of the people think the opposite.

#### The First Job Offer

This year I got my very first job offer, from one of the best firms in the world, _American Express._ I will be joining American Express in January 2019 as a Software Development Engineer Intern. It made this year better than ever. I am really excited about this one.

#### Traveling

Last year, I went on 4 trips. But this year, I couldn’t go on a single trip until last 3 days. Currently I am on my first and also last trip of the year to Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India. The trip started on the night of 28th December and will end on 2nd January morning. This trip is going pretty well till now. Shimla is the second most popular new year celebration destination in India. I’m gonna celebrate it in Shimla.

Yesterday I went to Kufri and played with snow there. Finally, one item out of the bucket list.

In Kufri, I also did the Zipline of 300 meters over the mountains and it was really a great experience. I’ll share more about the trip in my next post.

Let’s just not talk about new year resolution. You don’t really need a new year’s resolution to change or improve yourself. But I am sure about this, next year’s gonna be great.

Thanks for stopping by. Happy New Year.

2019 is ending today. There is a quote by Michael Altshuler which says, “_The bad news is time flies. The good news is you’re the pilot._”, The time flies very fast. I don’t even feel like I wrote [2018: The Year in Review](https://blog.priyanshrastogi.com/2018-the-year-in-review-c2f9f26f1804) a year ago.

So I ‘ll just cut it short. Here are some notable things happened to me this year.

#### Graduation

I finally got my undergraduate degree with a major in Computer Science and Engineering this year. I started in 2015 with an SGPA of 5.9 in the first semester and ended it with an SGPA of 10 in the last semester. Honestly, this college life was really a rollercoaster ride. There were ups and there were downs but in the end, on May 19, 2019, I got my degree.

#### First Job

I was interning at American Express as a Software Development Engineer Intern from January 2019 to June 2019. I finally got a Full-Time Offer from American Express which I accepted and currently working there.

#### So how was this year?

> “Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend.” — Theophrastus.

This quote is one of my favorites. But I couldn’t really follow it this year. I didn’t learn anything new except WebVR app development. I wasted a lot of time doing nothing. But I started working out this year. I lost a couple of kilograms of weight but not much because I wasn’t that regular. I hope to get it right from tomorrow.

#### Expectations from 2020

I am expecting a lot from 2020. Though I don’t have the resolutions ready and I am not planning to make resolutions. This year I tried to follow resolutions but failed miserably. So this year I am just telling myself to make some things right.

Also, I am working on a project “**X**” and hoping a lot from this too. I invested a lot of resources into this. So I will see how it turns out.

That’s it, folks. Have a nice day. Happy New Year.
